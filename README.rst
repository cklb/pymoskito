PyMoskito stands for *Python based modular simulation & postprocessing kickass
toolbox* and is **Free software** (GPLv3)

PyMoskito is targeted at students and researchers working in control
engineering. It takes care of all structure related programming a let's you
focus on the important things in life: **control design**
It features a modular control loop structure that already contains most of the
needed blocks a control engineer needs. Basically you implement your systems
dynamics as well as a fancy control law and you are ready to go.
On top PyMoskito also contains a GUI which let's you easily fine-tune the
parameters of your simulation.

**Go ahead and give it a try!**

PyMoskito at work:
------------------
The main application simulating the **Ball and Beam** system:

The postprocessing application:

Another example a **Double Pendulum**:

with custom prostprocessors:

Still here? So PyMoskito features:
----------------------------------
* quick setup due to lightweight dependencies
* modular control loop structure allowing easy configuration
* easy integration of own system models through open interface
* automatic simulation of simulation regimes (i.e. for parameter ranges)
* export of simulation results for dedicated post processing
* VTK based 3D visualization interface
* playback functions for 3D visualization
* ready-to-go graphs for all simulation signals
