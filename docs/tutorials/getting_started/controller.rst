Implementing a Controller
-------------------------

To close the loop a controller has to be added. 
This can easily be done by deriving from the :py:class:`~pymoskito.simulation_modules.Controller` class.
Its task is to stabilize the pendulum by calculating a suitable input for the model.
To keep things simple, the linear state-feedback controller in this scenario
and it is based on the linearized system which is given by

.. math::

    \boldsymbol{A} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        0 & \frac{m^{2}l^{2}g}{z} & -\frac{JD}{z} & \frac{mld}{z}\\
        0 & -\frac{(M+m)mlg}{z} & \frac{mlD}{z} & -\frac{(M+m)d}{z}\\
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \ \
    \boldsymbol{B} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0\\
        0\\
        \frac{J}{z}\\
        -\frac{ml}{z}\\
    \end{pmatrix} 
    \ \
    \boldsymbol{C} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    \end{pmatrix} 
    
with
    
.. math::
    
    z = J (M+m) - m^{2}l^{2}.
    
The linear control law is given by

.. math::
    
    u = -\boldsymbol{K} \boldsymbol{x} + \boldsymbol{V} \boldsymbol{y_d}

with the control gain :math:`\boldsymbol{K}`
and the prefilter :math:`\boldsymbol{V}`.
One possibility to calculate the control gain is by using the Ackermann formula.
    
With all necessary equations, the implementation of the controller class can begin.
Start by creating a file called::

    controller.py

Import the same classes as in the model class:

.. literalinclude:: /../pymoskito/examples/simple_pendulum/controller.py
    :end-before: # class begin
    :lineno-match:

Derive your controller from
:py:class:`~pymoskito.simulation_modules.Controller`
Next, create :py:data:`public_settings` as before in the model.
Its entries will be accessable in the graphical interface of PyMoskito during runtime.
This time, the only parameters will be the desired poles of the closed loop,
which the controller shall establish:

.. literalinclude:: /../pymoskito/examples/simple_pendulum/controller.py
    :start-after: # class begin
    :end-before: # init
    :lineno-match:

Within the constructor, it is obligatory to set the :py:class:`input order` and
an :py:class:`input type`.
The :py:class:`input order` determines how many derivatives of the trajectory
will be required, sinc eour controller is very simple a ``0`` will do here.
Valid entries for :py:data:`input type` are *Model_State*, *Model_Output*,
*Observer* and *Sensor*. In our case we will go for ``Model_State``.
After all necessary updates, call the constructor of the base class as seen in
line :py:data:`20`.
Store the linearized system matrices and the equilibrium state.
To make matrix operations possible, use the array type provided by NumPy.
PyMoskito's :doc:`Controltools <../modules/controltools>` provide functions
to calculate the values of a linear state feedback and a prefilter,
which can be used as seen in lines :py:data:`49-50`. 
The method :py:data:`place_siso()` is an implementation of the Ackermann formula:

.. literalinclude:: /../pymoskito/examples/simple_pendulum/controller.py
    :start-after: # init
    :end-before: # control
    :lineno-match:

That would be all for the constructor.
The only other method left to implement contains the actual control law and will
be called by the solver during runtime.
Its parameters are the current time, the current values of trajectory,
feedforward and controller input.
The parameter :py:data:`**kwargs` holds further information, which is explained
in :class:`pymoskito.simulation_modules.Controller`. For our example, we will just ignore it.
Since this controller will be stabilizing the system in the steady state [0,0,0,0],
it has to be subtracted to work on the small signal scale.

.. literalinclude:: /../pymoskito/examples/simple_pendulum/controller.py
    :start-after: # control
    :lineno-match:

Finally, import the controller file and register the controller class to PyMoskito
by adding two lines to the main.py file as done before with the model class.
Your `main.py` should now look like this, with the changed lines highlighted:

.. literalinclude:: /../pymoskito/examples/simple_pendulum/main.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-6,9-16,21-24
    :emphasize-lines: 6,14
    :linenos:

Having put all pieces together, we are now ready to run our scenario.
