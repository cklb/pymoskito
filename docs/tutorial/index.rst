Welcome to the PyMoskito Tutorial! It is intended to introduce new users to the toolbox. 
For more detailed descriptions, please see the :doc:`Full Users Guide <../guide/index>` or the 
:doc:`References <../modules/index>`.

Within this tutorial, the system "Pendulum on Cart" will be simulated.
With the implementation of a model and a controller, PyMoskito 
allows the simulation of a closed control loop and provides the results 
as diagrams.

All code is written in Python. If you want to refresh or expand 
your knowledge about this language, see the `Python Tutorial`_.
