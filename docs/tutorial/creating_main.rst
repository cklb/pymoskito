The __main__ File
---------------------

Every program needs a main. Therefore, the first file you create should be called::

	__main__.py

For a Quickstart, you can copy the following code, taken from the :doc:`'Ball and Beam' example <../examples/ballbeam>` . 

Alternatively, copying the file itself from the ballbeam directory is a quick and easy option.

Please note that the highlighted lines 29-33 refer to another file, which is yet to be created, 
but not essential to the program. You can either delete these lines, or read more about 
the default file :doc:`here <creating_default_regimes>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../pymoskito/examples/ballbeam/__main__.py
	:language: python
	:emphasize-lines: 29-33
	:linenos:
