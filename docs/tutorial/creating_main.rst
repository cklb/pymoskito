The __main__ File
---------------------

Every program needs a main. Therefore, the first file you create should be called::

	__main__.py

For a Quickstart, you can copy the following code, taken from the `'Ball and Beam' example`_ . 

.. _`'Ball and Beam' example`: https://pymoskito.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/ballbeam.html

Alternatively, copying the file itself from the ballbeam directory is a quick and easy option.

Please note that line 26-29 refer to another file, which is yet to be created, 
but not essential to the program. You can either delete these lines, or read more about 
the default file here_.
